Binary classification problem

DESCRIPTION
Background of Problem Statement : You are expected to write the code for a binary classification model (phishing website or not) using Python Scikit-Learn that trains on the data and calculates the accuracy score on the test data. You have to use one or more of the classification algorithms to train a model on the phishing website dataset.

Problem Objective : The dataset is a text file which provides the following resources that can be used as inputs for model building : A collection of website URLs for 11000+ websites. Each sample has 30 website parameters and a class label identifying it as a phishing website or not (1 or -1).
The code template containing these code blocks: Import modules (Part 1) Load data function + input/output field descriptions The dataset also serves as an input for project scoping and tries to specify the functional and non-functional requirements for it.

Domain: Cyber Security and Web Mining

Questions to be answered with analysis :
Write the code for a binary classification model (phishing website or not) using Python Scikit-Learn that trains on the data and calculates the accuracy score on the test data. Use one or more of the classification algorithms to train a model on the phishing website dataset.
